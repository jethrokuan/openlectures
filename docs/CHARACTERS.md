# Character System

## Overview

Each user begins as a `human`. This shows that he has no race.

Gradually, as he spends time in each of the different areas of OL (OL, OQ and ON), he will gain a race.

`race` is determined by how often the user uses each of the 3 products -- OL, OQ, and ON.

- OL: Adventurer
- OQ: Space Warrior
- ON: Mutant

`xp` is gained after each event (be it watching a video, asking a question, answering a question, contributing to notes etc). xp pours into each of the 3 race that the user has. For example, by watching a video, an user increases his OL xp. 

`class` is a separate concept from race. Class is a specialization, for example Economics, Physics etc.

- Economics: Keynesian
- Physics: Newtonian
- Chemistry: Curiean
- Biology: Darwinian
- Mathematics: Eulerian
- Geography: Wegenerian
- General Paper: Pulitzerian

We will ask users to select their favorite subject. This will then be their class. Classes can be changed at any time.

`level` is gained after certain amounts of xp is reached. Level is specific to the area of OL. So a user will have a OL level, OQ level, ON level and an total level. 

At certain levels, users will gain certain `item`s. These items provide xp boosts or other forms of boosts. Items are also given at character creation.

`title` is bestowed on high ranking players. For example, the top OL user will be called "Super Saiyan"

## Purpose

This unites the entire OL "ecosystem" under one common currency -- xp. This also subconsciously breaks down the barriers between each of the areas, allowing users from all 3 different areas to interact.

Levels, items, and titles reward (or rather feed the egos) of the users.

It facilitates data mining from users. For example, 

# Race

Race will first be selected during character creation.

Then, depending on his XP from each of the 3 sections of OL, we will determine his race.

Hence race can be switched at any time depending on how much XP the user gains from each section (OQ, OL and ON).

# Class

Class shows the specialization of the character (the titles are above). Names of items, 

The user decides the class, and can be switched at any time by going to a 'career fair'.

The main purpose of class is to "customize" the items a player receives. 

# Item

Every 3 levels, the user receives an item. That item gives him a constant xp boost. 

- The first item will give him a +1 xp on every activity that awards xp
- Second item will give +2 etc.

This is sort of an incentive for the player to keep progressing.

The name of the item depends on the class. This is shown in the Ranks.pdf document.

# Character Creation

During character creation, we will ask for these information

- Choose to be an adventurer, space warrior, or mutant (tell them that each represents one section of OL that they will use the most)
- Tell them to choose their favorite subject (and hence choosing their class)
- Tell us where they're from (School)

This character creation process should emulate an RPG game. Why? Allows us to elicit more information from users without making them feel like such.

# Experience Points

## Conversion to CIP Hours

- 100 xp = 1 CIP hour

## Awarding of XP

The numbers indicated below are base rates. We should be able to fluctuate the base rate based on certain events. (eg. pre-exams, we want more people to come and answer questions. Hence, we award `x2 XP` during that period.)

XP should also allow for modifiers from the items. Hence, this is the formula for XP calculation per activity

`XP Awarded = Base XP * Event + Item Modifier`

`Event = 1` in most cases. We will adjust it according to "market dynamics".


## OL 

- Finishing a video: 3xp
- Sharing a video: 2xp

## OQ

Each question has a "bounty". Answering a question is called "looting".

- Asking a question: 3xp
- Answering a question: Depending on the difficulty of the question answered, xp varies.
	- Primary School Level: 5xp
	- Secondary School Level: 10xp
	- JC Level: 15xp
	- University Level: 25xp
- For any unanswered question, xp awarded goes up by 1xp every 1 hour to incentivize people to answer them.
- Each upvote received gets you 0.5xp

### Deciding Who Gets the XP

For each question

- The mod will need to close the question to show that the question has been answered. At this point
	- The mod will need to choose a right answer. That guy gets the loot.
	- The answer that has the most votes gets the loot too.
	- If these two happen to be the same guy, only one instance of the loot is awarded. Otherwise, both people get the loot.

## ON

Yet to be decided. Just say that "the dungeon is still closed."
